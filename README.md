## An interactive pomodoro timer written and designed by me for [FAC](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/)21 week 4.

I would like to start off by saying that what I am most proud of in this project is the pun "split() my time", with the two time inputs being split into an array.  
I make a lot of terrible puns, but this one is actually half decent and that is such an achievement for me :sparkler:

### Task: Create a [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer with the following features: 
- A “work” timer that counts down to zero (usually 25 minutes)
- A second “break” timer that counts down to zero (usually 5 minutes)
- Buttons to start a session, pause the timer, or cancel the session and restart
- Customisable lengths of time for work/break
- Play an alarm sound to make it obvious the time is up

## An interactive pomodoro timer written and designed by me for FAC21 week 4.

I would like to start off by saying that what I am most proud of in this project is the pun "split() my time", with the two time inputs being split into an array.  
I make a lot of terrible puns, but this one is actually half decent and that is such an achievement for me :sparkler:
